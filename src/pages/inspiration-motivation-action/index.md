I watch a lot of people on the Internet. [Authors](http://sethgodin.typepad.com), [film makers](https://www.youtube.com/user/caseyneistat), [music producers](https://www.youtube.com/user/Hopsintv). I often wonder where do these guys get inspiration and motivation.

It came down to be one thing.

Inspiration is like metabolism. You have to put it in work in order to start working. It won't work by it's own. If you just sit and wait, it won't start working.

Do. Be a doer. Regularly.
