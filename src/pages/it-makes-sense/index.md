You won’t rush an architect. You don’t want to see your house becoming dust at the next earthquake. 

You won’t rush your hairdresser. You don’t want to leave that place with one ear.

You won’t rush your dentist. You can’t handle the pain.

You won’t rush your local restaurant chef. You know good beef takes time to cook.

You won’t rush your wife to deliver your baby in less than 9 months. Why would you?

But you will rush your developer to build the next Facebook in 48 hours.

It makes sense.
