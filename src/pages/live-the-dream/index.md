Sometimes we feel like still chasing the dream. Like it is still far away. 

Think again. What were you dreaming of last year? Five years ago? What about when you were 15 years old. What was your goal back then? 

I feel like I'm living my last year's dream. I do. And now I dream bigger. I want to  feel it again next year. And after five years. And after thirty years.

I forgot that I am already living my dream.
